## Core Concept

Soul SMP is a hardcore survival experience where death matters. You have a limited number of lives, and losing them all results in permanent spectator mode (permadeath). Collect Soul Orbs from player deaths to purchase upgrades and extend your survival.

### Key Features

- **Limited Lives:** Start with 10, maximum of 15
- **Soul Orbs:** Currency dropped on death
- **Buff Items:** Permanent effects while held in offhand
- **Extra Hearts:** Increase max health
- **Corruption:** Penalty for hoarding orbs
- **Permadeath:** 0 lives = spectator mode

---

## Life System

### Starting Lives

- All players start with **10 lives**
- Maximum possible: **15 lives** (with Soul Sigils)
- Minimum: **0** (permadeath)

### Losing Lives

- **-1 life** per death
- Death causes:
  - Player kills
  - Mob kills
  - Environmental hazards (lava, fall damage, etc.)
  - Void deaths

### Death Consequences

When you die:

1. ‚ù§Ô∏è **Lose 1 life**
2. ‚ö´ **Drop 1 Soul Orb** at death location
3. üí™ **Lose all active buffs** (items dropped on ground)
4. üíî **Lose all extra hearts** (back to 20 HP)
5. üì¢ **Server announcement** of life count

### Permadeath

- Occurs when lives reach **0**
- **Immediate** switch to spectator mode
- **Cannot respawn** or play normally
- Can still chat and spectate
- Requires admin reset to restore

### Viewing Lives

- **Actionbar:** Top of screen shows `‚ù§ Lives: X/15`
- **Command:** Type `!info` for detailed stats
- **Scoreboard:** Optional sidebar display

---

## Soul Orbs

### What are Soul Orbs?

Soul Orbs (‚ö´) are the primary currency in Soul SMP. They drop from player deaths and are used to purchase upgrades.

### Obtaining Soul Orbs

- **Player Death:** 1 orb dropped per death
- **Crafting Recipe:**
  - 4 Netherite Blocks
  - 4 Enchanted Golden Apples
  - 1 End Crystal
  - Arranged: N-A-N / A-C-A / N-A-N
- **Location:** Spawns where player died
- **Visibility:** Has glowing effect for 5 minutes
- **Despawn:** Standard 5-minute item despawn timer

### Using Soul Orbs

Open the shop with `!shop` to spend orbs on:

- **Buff Items:** 2-6 orbs depending on tier
- **Extra Hearts:** 2 orbs per heart
- **Soul Sigil:** 5 orbs for +1 life

### Orb Management

- **Stack Size:** 64 per slot
- **Storage:** Can be stored in chests safely
- **Trading:** Can drop for other players
- **Warning:** Carrying 7+ orbs causes corruption!

---

## Buff System

### How Buffs Work

Buff items provide permanent potion effects **while held in your offhand**.

- ‚úÖ **Equip in offhand** = Effect active
- ‚ùå **Remove from offhand** = Effect removed
- üíÄ **Death** = All buff items lost
- üì¶ **Storage** = Can be stored without effect

### Buff Types & Costs

#### Strength (‚öîÔ∏è)

| Tier | Effect      | Cost     |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| I    | Strength I  | 2 orbs   |
| II   | Strength II | 4 orbs   |
| III  | Strength III| 6 orbs   |

**Use Case:** Increased melee damage

#### Resistance (üõ°Ô∏è)

| Tier | Effect        | Cost     |
| ---- | ------------- | -------- |
| I    | Resistance I  | 2 orbs   |
| II   | Resistance II | 4 orbs   |
| III  | Resistance III| 6 orbs   |

**Use Case:** Reduced damage taken

#### Regeneration (üíö)

| Tier | Effect          | Cost     |
| ---- | --------------- | -------- |
| I    | Regeneration I  | 2 orbs   |
| II   | Regeneration II | 4 orbs   |
| III  | Regeneration III| 6 orbs   |

**Use Case:** Faster health recovery

### Buff Combining

Combine two identical buffs to upgrade them:

- **2x Tier I** ‚Üí 1x Tier II
- **Tier II CANNOT combine** (max tier for combining)
- **Tier III can be purchased** but NOT crafted via combining

**How to Combine:**

1. Drop both buff items on the ground
2. Items must be same type and tier
3. Only **Tier I** items can combine (prevents OP stacking)
4. They will automatically combine when close
5. Particle effects indicate success

**Example:**

- Drop 2x Strength I ‚Üí Get 1x Strength II
- Drop 2x Strength II ‚Üí Nothing (cannot combine)

### Tips

- Only **one buff active** at a time (offhand limitation)
- Switch buffs by changing offhand item
- Store unused buffs in chest
- Higher tiers = better effects but higher cost
- Lost on death - use wisely!

---

## Extra Hearts

### What are Extra Hearts?

Extra Hearts permanently increase your maximum health (until death).

- **Cost:** 2 Soul Orbs per heart
- **Maximum:** 5 extra hearts
- **Health Bonus:** +2 HP per heart (1 heart = 2 HP)
- **Max Health:** 30 HP (20 base + 10 extra)
- **Display:** Red hearts (‚ù§) in HUD

### Purchasing Hearts

1. Type `!shop` to open the shop
2. Select "‚ù§ Extra Hearts"
3. Purchase with 2 Soul Orbs
4. Instantly gain +2 HP
5. Repeat up to 5 times

### Heart Mechanics

- ‚úÖ **Persist** through normal gameplay
- ‚úÖ **Stack** with armor/effects
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lose 1 heart per death** (not all of them)
- ‚úÖ **Can be repurchased** after respawn
- ‚ùå **Eventually reset** after 5 deaths with max hearts

### Strategy

- **Early Game:** Prioritize survival (buy hearts)
- **Mid Game:** Balance hearts with buffs
- **Late Game:** Max hearts before risky activities

---

## Soul Sigil

### What is the Soul Sigil?

The Soul Sigil (‚ú¶) is a rare relic that **permanently increases your maximum lives** by 1.

### Mechanics

- **Cost:** 5 Soul Orbs
- **Effect:** +1 permanent life (survives death)
- **Maximum:** Can use until 15/15 lives
- **Usage:** Use the item (right-click)

### Obtaining

1. Collect 5 Soul Orbs
2. Type `!shop` ‚Üí select "‚ú¶ Soul Sigil"
3. Confirm purchase (5 orbs consumed)
4. Use the Soul Sigil item
5. Gain +1 life permanently

### Strategic Use

- **Best Time:** When you have orbs to spare
- **Priority:** Lower priority than immediate survival
- **Late Game:** Essential for reaching 15 lives
- **Risk:** Expensive if you die before using it

### Example

- Start: 10/15 lives
- Use Soul Sigil: 11/15 lives
- Die 3 times: 8/15 lives (still have +1 from sigil)

## Corruption

### What is Corruption?

Corruption is a negative effect that punishes players for hoarding Soul Orbs.

### Corruption Tiers

| Orbs   | Tier | Effects                                  |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0-6    | 0    | None - Safe                              |
| 7-8    | 1    | Weakness II                              |
| 9-11   | 2    | Weakness II + Hostile Mobs               |
| 12+    | 3    | Weakness II + Slowness I + Hostile Mobs  |

### Hostile Mobs Effect

- **Increased aggression** from all mobs
- **Larger detection range** (mobs notice you from farther)
- **Neutral mobs turn hostile** (Endermen, Piglins)
- **Cannot be removed** until orb count decreases

### Corruption Indicators

- **Actionbar Warning:** "‚ö† CORRUPTION" in red
- **Particle Effects:** Soul particles around player
- **HUD Color:** Orb count turns red
- **Screen Title:** "CORRUPTION TIER X"

### Avoiding Corruption

1. **Spend orbs quickly** - don't hoard
2. **Maximum safe:** 6 orbs
3. **Buy items regularly** from shop
4. **Store orbs in chests** (doesn't count toward corruption)
5. **Trade excess orbs** to teammates

### Removing Corruption

- Reduce orb count below tier threshold
- Effects removed automatically
- Spend orbs at the shop
- Drop orbs (risky!)
